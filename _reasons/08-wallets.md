intro: Options from full nodes to easy-to-use web wallets!

There are wallet options from running a full node, to using a simple but secure web wallet.

- **Smapp** — Smapp is the project’s official wallet. The downside of using Smapp *only* as a wallet, is that it’s also a full node, which has to be fully in sync in order to access your SMH funds. And that means keeping it running 24/7.
- **SmeshWallet** — [SmeshWallet](https://smeshwallet.com) is a free web wallet created by the author of this document. It can additionally serve as a companion to Smapp, ensuring that your SMH funds are always available, even if Smapp is not fully sync’d.

You can learn about more about [SmeshWallet security here](https://smeshwallet.com/security), and the trade-offs of using it alternatively or in combination with Smapp [here](https://smeshwallet.com/security).
