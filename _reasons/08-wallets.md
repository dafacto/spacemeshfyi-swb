intro: Options from full nodes to easy-to-use web wallets!
type: reason
---

There are wallet options from running a full node, to using a simple but secure web wallet.

- **Smapp** — Smapp is the project’s official wallet. The downside of using Smapp *only* as a wallet, is that it’s also a full node, which has to be fully in sync in order to access your SMH funds. And that means keeping it running 24/7.
- **Smapp-Lite** — [Smapp-Lite](https://spacemesh.io/wallet/) is the project’s official web wallet, which does not require running a full node. 
- **SmeshWallet** — [SmeshWallet](https://smeshwallet.com) is an alternative free web wallet created by the author of this document, focused on user-experience, and used by thousands of people since January 2024.
