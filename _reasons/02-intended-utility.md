Unlike Bitcoin, Spacemesh is not targeting the money/currency use case, in which SMH would be used for payments. 

Instead, Spacemesh intends to implement a “Virtual Machine”, which supports **smart-contracts**, such that it would compete with blockchains like Ethereum as a **global decentralized computer**, on which businesses could build and operate decentralized applications (dApps).

True to its roots, Spacemesh designed a virtual machine architecture from first-principle thinking and solid engineering trade-off analyses, that is unique within the crypto industry. It’s called “Athena” and is [described in this blog article](https://spacemesh.io/blog/introducing-athena/).

The long-term objective for Spacemesh is that Athena will enable unique, and likely unforeseen use-cases that will compel businesses to choose to build their dApps on Spacemesh, rather than competing blockchains.
