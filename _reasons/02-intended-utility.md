Unlike Bitcoin, Spacemesh is not targeting the money/currency use case, in which SMH would be used for payments. 

Instead, Spacemesh intends to implement a "Virtual Machine", which supports **smart-contracts**, such that it would compete with blockchains like Ethereum as a **global decentralized computer**, on which businesses could build and operate decentralized applications (dApps).

This means that for Spacemesh to succeed in the long-term, it will need to convince businesses to choose to build their dApps on Spacemesh, rather than competing blockchains.
