The Spacemesh [tokenomics model](https://spacemesh.io/blog/spacemesh-economics-intro/) was inspired by Bitcoin, i.e. the large majority of coins are fairly allocated to miners, with a small percentage allocated to the team and initial investors, with smoothly vesting over four years, and will represent about 6% when the final SMH coin is mined in about 2000 years!
