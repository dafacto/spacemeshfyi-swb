From Discord to Telegram, here’s where to get involved or get support.

- **Discord** — The primary community is located in [Discord](https://chat.spacemesh.io/). While the team members are not listed in the Discord (but do participate), those community members who have made contributions are given the role “Contributor” and tend to be the most knowledgeable.
- **Telegram** — Three community Telegram groups, one in [English](https://t.me/spacemeshen), one in [French](https://t.me/spacemeshfr), and the other in [Chinese](https://t.me/spacemesh_chinese), are operated by community members.

Now that you’ve learned all the basics, let’s have a look at [some additional resources](/resources).
