From Discord to Telegram, here’s where to get involved or get support.

- **Discord** — The primary community is located in [Discord](https://chat.spacemesh.io/). While the team members are not listed in the Discord (but do participate), those community members who have made contributions are given the role “Contributor” and tend to be the most knowledgeable.
- **Telegram** — Several language-specific Telegram groups are operated by community members: [English](https://t.me/spacemeshen), [French](https://t.me/spacemeshfr), [Chinese](https://t.me/spacemesh_chinese), [Vietnamese](https://t.me/Spacemeshvietnam), [Netherlands/Belgium](https://t.me/smh_nl_be) and [Russian](https://t.me/Spacemesh_rus).
