If you are interested in running a smeshing node and earning SMH rewards, you have two choices. 

- **Smapp** — The project's desktop application which combines three capabilities—a node, "smeshing", and a wallet. This is the intended application for the typical home miner, and [this article](https://blog.fabioiotti.com/posts/spacemesh-smapp-smeshing/) provides a step-by-step guide to setting it up.
- **go-spacemesh** — The project's CLI software, intended for advanced miners who may be running multiple nodes on a single computer, and "smeshing" multiple sets of postdata. If interested, [I posted a blog article](https://dafacto.com/2023/how-to-run-multiple-spacemesh-nodes-on-macos) about how I run four nodes—one "public", and three "private"—at home using a Mac mini and four external SSD drives.

Let's now look at [where you can find coin data and buy SMH. →](/coin-data)
